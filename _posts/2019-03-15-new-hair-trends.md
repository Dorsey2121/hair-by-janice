Volume , bobs and baby fringes are all the rage for spring! 

Think going short means you have to sacrifice the snaz? Think again! Pins, barrettes and hair accessories can pick up any short look. Customize your look with some cute clips and go into spring with style . 

For the long hair looks, triple buns and up up up! Messy or neat it's all ok. Fun is the feel!
